## To the lovely Sharon

Thank you for your letter. I am extremely thankful for the talks we have had over the past 3 weeks, especially Friday morning. I can't believe how much I learnt about ourselves in that 1 hour, what we needed from each other, for ourselves and for one another. Communication is important, and I am kicking myself for not putting enough emphasis on this type of open communication, during our time together, but this is all in hindsight.

Thank you for letting me see a side of myself that I didn't notice much of before, that I was too agreeable, and its direct impact on the dynamics of our relationship. There were plenty of times this has happened, but I have come to realize, in a way, this trait of mine, was my final downfall. Even in the final moments, three weeks ago on Friday night, when you suggested we go our separate ways, however much I wanted to fight for this, however much I wanted all this to work out, somehow I still agreed. Thinking back now, I can't believe I did that. Of course, it was on the spur of the moment, I did not have the time to recollect my thoughts like what I have done now, nor had the chance to talk candidly with you on what went wrong. Being the logic freak that I am, I did something I have come to regret, I agreed. As I see it, a much more meaningful discussion could have bloomed, if and only if I had disagreed and insisted we talk about it and going over the details, before making a decision. For all I know, that would not have made any difference, and we would have still separated, but evidently I now know what you mean by me being too agreeable. That being said, I really liked our discussion on Friday morning, I had a lot of fun, we gave each other a platform to display our thoughts, and to ponder the reasons behind them, and I am glad I managed to connect some dots regarding communication.

After thinking through your letter, I think I have some inkling about the topic of family background as well. Like I previously mentioned, some of these connections only came to me after lots of troubled thoughts and meditation, but I believe I may have found something. You were my best friend, my partner, and it would seem, my family as well. Parallel to your observation that our definition of love and commitment might be different, I have found similarities in my love for you and that of for members of my family. Although with the intention to love, putting you as an important role in the core of my being, has not been without consequences, and it has manifested in the form of reliance, neglect and more often than not, taking things for granted. There is no argument here, just an interesting observation that I hope might shed some light for both of us in our pursuit of the meaning of love and commitment.

I had a rough Thursday night, after reading the Sacred Heart of Jesus Novena Prayer:

<strong>
Lord Jesus, 
the needs of your people open your heart in love to each of us. 
You care for us when we are lost, 
sympathise with us in lonliness and comfort us in mourning; 
you are closest to us when we are at our weakest. 
You love us most when we love ourselves least; 
you forgive us most when we forgive ourselves least; 
you call us to spread your love in whatever way we can.
</strong>

I was pretty lost and helpless mentally to say the least, and those words meant a lot to me then and even now. Our faith journey together through RCIA

Similarly before I left for overseas studies, once again, I find myself writing something for you, only this time its not a chinese caligraphy portrait. I wish I had learnt all this under very different circumstances, and not only after we have agreed to go our separate ways. Closure for me won't happen over night, or a short period of time, but I will work on it, along with my whole self and my faith journey. Thank you for being you, and being a large part of my life.
